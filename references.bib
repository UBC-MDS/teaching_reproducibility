We write to explain what happened and to request retraction of this article.In this study, we had tested a 3-month hospital-initiated program that combined transition and long-term management support for patients hospitalized for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We had originally reported that the intervention, compared with usual care, resulted in a fewer number of mean COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits at 6 months per participant (0.72 [95\% CI, 0.45-0.97] vs 1.40 [95\% CI, 1.01-1.79]) and an adjusted difference in the 100-point St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score between groups of -6.69 (95\% CI, -12.97 to -0.40; P\,=\,.04). The correct results reverse the main finding to more COPD-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits in the intervention group vs the usual care group (1.40 [95\% CI, 1.10-1.79] vs 0.72 [95\% CI, 0.46-0.97]) and an adjusted difference in the SGRQ score that is no longer statistically different (5.18 [95\% CI, -2.15 to 12.51]; P\,=\,.11). Here we describe the detected errors and the additional analyses that have been conducted.}
